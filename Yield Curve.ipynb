    "##### **1. Normal Yield Curve:**<br>\n",
    "A normal yield curve shows low yields for shorter-maturity bonds and then increases for bonds with a longer maturity, sloping upwards. <br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "**Reason for upward slope:** lenders and bond investors who commit to tying up their money for longer periods of time take on more risk because it’s harder to forecast economic conditions – inflation, Federal Reserve policy, the global economy – over a decade than over the next week or month. The extra compensation that lenders and investors demand for making long-term loans is known as the term premium. With a positive term premium, the yield curve usually slopes upwards."

    "\n",
    "Because long-term rate consists two components: term spread and expected short-term rate path over the lifetime of the bond. While the term spread stays positive most of the time, long-term interest rate would go down – inverting the yield curve – if markets expect that the economy will deteriorate and that the Fed will cut short-term rates in the future.\n",
