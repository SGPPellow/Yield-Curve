# Yield-Curve

## Treasury

Treasure bonds/notes/bills are all fixed-income securities sold by the federal government.

### Maturity:

1.  **Bonds**: more than 10 years.
2.  **Notes**: 2 to 10 years.
3.  **Bill**: less than a year.

## Yield Curve Inversion

A yield curve is a line that plots yields, or interest rates, of bonds that have equal credit quality but differing maturity dates.

### Normal Yield Curve

Lenders and bond investors who commit to tying up their money for longer periods of time take on more risk because it’s harder to forecast economic conditions – inflation, Federal Reserve policy, the global economy – over a decade than over the next week or month.

The extra compensation that lenders and investors demand for making long-term loans is known as the term premium.
With a positive term premium, the yield curve usually slopes upwards.
